# Day 05/Day 30: Simple Calculator
ðŸš€ Excited to share my Day 5 project of the 30-Day Challenge! Today, I built a simple calculator app using Next.js and the ShadCN library.

This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, all while providing a smooth user experience.


Working on this project has enhanced my skills in Next.js and React component libraries. I faced some challenges with implementing the ShadCN library but found great solutions through experimentation and learning.

I would love to hear your thoughts! Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think in the comments below!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
